    <h3><span class="blue-text">Growing up in Atlantic County, I visited 
      <a href="https://www.atlanticlibrary.org/">     
        <u>this website </u>
      </a> 
     weekly to check for book availability and local events, but I often struggled to naviagte it and often left the site frustrated. Some of the main issues I noticed are detailed below. </span></h3>
    </span></h3>

    <h5><u>Website Efficiency </u></h5>

    <h3>The two search bars are initally hard to see and can be confused with each other. It's hard to understand the goal of the website: searching the book catalog and finding local events.</h3>

    <h3>There is a lot of information initially presented on the screen, which can be overwhelming for users and can distract users finding what they need.
      </h3>

    <h3>There are repetitive elements, like text and the multiple “Upcoming Events” sections.</h3>

    <h5><u>Website Learnability </u></h5>

    <h3>Again, the amount of text and components the user is presentend with can make it hard for them to digest the information, making the website hard to learn. </h3>

    <h3>Personally, I visted the website many times before I realized there is a search bar available to browse the website. This is becuase it is hidden away at the bottom of the screen.
    </h3>

    <h5><u>Website Memorability</u></h5>

    <h3>The website is not memorable at all. The color scheme, while nice, is pretty neutral. There is nothing setting this site apart. </h3>


    <h5><u>Website's Conceptual Model</u></h5>

    <h3>Overall, the amount of information is very overwhelming, which makes it difficult for users to understand the conceptual model of the website. 
      </h3>
    <h3>The lack of clear hierarchy and organization of information makes it difficult for users to understand how to navigate the site.</h3>

    
    <h5><u>Main Issues with Website Accessibility</u></h5>

    <h3>WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools found 21 errors, 75 alerts, and 8 contrast errors with the site</h3>

    <h3>Most alerts were about empty links, redundant titles and text, and many images and titles missing alternative text.</h3>

    <h4><span class="blue-text">Taking these issues into account, I started redesigning the library website starting with a...</span></h4>
    
    <h5>Visual Design Style Guide  </h5>

    <div id="styleGuideGallery">
      <h4><span class="blue-text"> This visual design style guide displays the main colors, typography, and reusable components’ different states (buttons on hover, click, etc.). The clear documentation shows the consistency of the design work and makes handoffs to other members on a team easier.</span></h4>
      <img class="styleGuide" src="./assets/style-guide.png"/>
    </div> 

    <h4><span class="blue-text">To see these components and new ideas in action, I next created</span> three (Large Computer, Tablet, and Phone) figma mockups <span class="blue-text">on what the site will look like. These mockups are annotated with the new changes I made and how developers would go about recreating these design choices.
