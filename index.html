  <h4 class="padding-top"> WOW! You have to agree that looks so much better! While doing this project, I had a lot of thoughts and have comprised them for you below in my reflection!
  </h4>
  <p> Most of the dropdown menus I observed had signifiers that made them at least somewhat learnable when using a mouse.
However, the dropdown features were not always not most accessible when using keyboard shortcuts, which could be confusing especially if you switch between using your mouse and keyboard. 
Yes, for one of my state designs, I added in being able to tab out of a dropdown menu, which could improve the learnability of the feature as users are already used to this motion.
Applying the definition of mismatch from the video, the change I made in my design makes the discovery portion of the learning experience much easier as the drop down menu will appear on a simple hover. This could get clunky, which is why the action must be a prolonged hover to indicate the intent.
Components that tend to do well, overall, are ones with easy discoverability and learnability. Often, these components are modeled after their real-life counterparts, like computer files and the trash bin.

Drop down menus that do not appear, have the cursor change states, or outline the button on a hover can be very confusing to people who do not know a drop down menu is there. 
Mouse users are definitely the most commonly prioritized feature in the process of creating components for websites, which causes most websites to be catered to these users. For apps, those are definitely catered towards touch features, which again favor able-bodied users</p>
